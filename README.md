# Logistics

Logistics is an engineless 2D game which uses SDL2 in order to be lightweight and compatible with many different machines. In Logistics, you are a cinder block, and you must navigate the pitfalls of corporate bureaucracy in a number of high-stakes arcade-style challenges. The current game is a demo of the "engine,", with minigames in development.

## Running

In order to play the game, you currently must have the Rust toolchain installed in order to build from source. The best way to install Rust is via the [rust-lang website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), as well as SDL2, which you can install via your system's package manager.

Once you have Rust and SDL2 installed, clone the project, `cd` into the root directory, and `cargo run` in order to compile and run the game.

## Note

Without Sunjay Varma's wonderful [tutorial](https://sunjay.dev/learn-game-dev/intro.html), I would not have been able to get started on this projectâ€”the basic layout of my code, game loop, etc., were constructed in the process of following that tutorial.
